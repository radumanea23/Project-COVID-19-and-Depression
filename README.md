# Project-COVID-19-and-Depression
#PROJECT OVERVIEW
As a group we were interested in mental health as a research topic, and through our experiences through the uncertain and challenging times
of the COVID-19 time period, we grew interested in looking into the possible relationships that may exist between the pandemic time period
and the consequences it may have had on mental health. We looked at three specific types of mental health disorders (depression, anxiety,
and a combination of depression or anxiety) across different regions of the United States as well as different age groups across the US.
We analyzed the distributions of these mental disorders across these different groups throughout the COVID-19 time period to uncover if there
were any patterns between age groups or regions in America. Our results showed that the Southwest region and the youngest age group had the
highest levels of these mental disorders throughout the COVID-19 time period and were different from the mean levels of these mental disorders
of the other regional and age groups.
